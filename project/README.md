Welcome to the Data Products final project page that covers the creation of a Shiny app and RPRes deck to present the app. 

The app was created using:
- [R studio's Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/)
- [rCharts](http://ramnathv.github.io/rCharts/)
- [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com) data sources related to game of thrones made available freely for data analysis.
- The app can also be accessed [here](https://minitelle.shinyapps.io/project/).
- All code used can be found [here](https://github.com/minitelle/DP/tree/master/project).

- A slide deck presenting the app and how to use it can be found on [RPubs here](http://rpubs.com/minitelle/ddp_got).
